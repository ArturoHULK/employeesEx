Simple REST spring boot project for employees, showing the basics and using DAOs with H2 database.
Note: the downside of using our own DAOs instead of Spring DataJ PA own interfaces is that there may be many boilerplate code for DAOs since we would need to create for every entity
that will perfom CRUD operation against DB.
